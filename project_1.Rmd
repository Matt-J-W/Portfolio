# Context
This fictional delivery company uses a range of vehicles, routes, and delivery types, they need to figure out how to improve their fuel efficiency without out impacting their revenue.

This data was sourced from Kaggle and uses the following tools:
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

# Approach
I started by importing and exploring the data, checking for completeness and standardisation.
```{r, knitr, include = FALSE}

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{python, data import}

import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

data_import = pd.read_excel(r"C:\Users\Matthew.Webb12\Desktop\GitHub Repos\Portfolio\python data\carbon_emissions_fleet_dataset.xlsx")

print(data_import.head())
print(data_import.columns)

# Exploring the data for completeness
columns_to_check = ["Vehicle_Type", "Route_Type", "Delivery_Type"]

# Create empty dictionary for the tables to be stored in
count_tables = {} 

for col in columns_to_check:
  count_tables[col] = data_import[col].value_counts().to_frame(name="Count")
  
```

<div style="display:flex; gap:20px;">

<div style="flex:1;">
```{python, include = FALSE}
count_tables[columns_to_check[0]]
```
</div>

<div style="flex:1;">
```{python, include = FALSE}
count_tables[columns_to_check[1]]
```
</div>

<div style="flex:1;">
```{python, include = FALSE}
count_tables[columns_to_check[2]]
```
</div>

</div>
